NER Data
==========

http://144.76.110.170:8086/training/ner/convert_to_label_studio

this url will fetch data from ai errors collection and create version folder like v2, v3 etc.

files need to copied from these version folder to the main and label-studio project should be restarted for labelling data

e.g
cp -rf label-studio/ner/project/backup/v2/* label-studio/ner/project/
sudo docker-compose restart label-studio-ner

COCO Annotator
=================

http://144.76.110.170:8086/training/viz/convert_for_annotation

get cv's for annanotaion. manually download and copy the images


http://176.9.137.77:5000/#/datasets

its not part of this docker compse, its using orgianl docker-compose file itself 
https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator/
itself and running as a seperate service


there is a dataset called resume/ which has all the images

there is a folder called trainig/coco which has all the trainig data.

this needs to be updated manually from time to time

current process for this to work

1. we open recruit system. go through the cv's there if we find issue we report it. the url gets saved in db
2. user needs to manually go into db. find the url open it on browser. see manually if the parsed was bad.
3. if parsing was bad, download the cv via browser and create a directly.
4. delete the data from db manually
5. upload it to server manually and do tagging there again

supervisor commands

supervisorctl reread
supervisorctl update all
supervisorctl start recruitai
supervisorctl restart recruitai



=========
TODO

b) Classification of emails (done)
c) Word2Vec skill api (done)

d) TBD. Semantic Search
e) TBD. Candidate Scoring
f) TBD. Male/Female based on name





TBD. small things
a) redis lock issue test (done)
b) take cv text from nodejs as well, but they say that can take text of full page only
or maybe try myself with textract same as nodejs
== done
3) delete file from filesystem when processing is done, as this is taking too much space (done)
4) need to work on test cases
5) need to setup metricbeat




in the micro service(done)
a) store results in redis (done)
b) create another mq for elastic search?
c) directly write to mongodb of recruit (done)
d) we are not writing to elastic search (done)
f) make app also inta seperate api microservice (done)
g) fix the async exception in resume mq
f) move amqurl to config. small task (done)

h) for the micro services make input / output patterns so its configurable and not limited to just mongo (skipped)
== i think output should be on mongodb.
== because if we make expressapi, then need to worry about authentication, security, server going down etc.
== no need to create any api
== better to directly use mongodb access. 

i) create stats and proper log tracking across services

j) see api gateway like kong and see linkerd.io with kubernotes and open trace for logging

h) make recruit node and angular also docker based

g) there is an issue, suppose any micro service is down. but api is fired, even in microervice is started in next 5sec it doesn't repose. it only responds to new api request not old onces

h) need to look at candidate resume text data sync for faster processing and this can be used to update elastic search as well (done testing pending)


g) integrate candidate skill with add resume process (done but testing pending)


g) seperate pic/ner/ner classify into seperate micro services(postponed)
ner, nerclassify, picture. == i don't see much advantage of doing this except just to make code clean
== can do it later (not important)

h) need to put test for every micro service 
i) need to setup swagger for api
j) need to remove the doc to pdf code from resumemq as its part of imagemq now


g)
# data sync mq
 # this is very very slow for full job profile 
# need to add bulk to search or something

h) setup stats for ai, inclding time taken, pending etc how long it will take

j) make files common and reusable between microservices

l) delete job profile, etc won't update data sync right now. this is a problem.
when we do full datasync it should delete all previous keys and create new.
we can schedule this one or twice a day as well (completed)

m) need to make this muti account with priority & setup priority tasks for latest cvs






datasync neds to be faster. right now, there was bulk update of all tag_ids in a job profile.
this takes very very long
