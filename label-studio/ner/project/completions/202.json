MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory- bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been \n presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods. \n Technical and Co-Curricular activities Star Performer in Microsoft IGTSC in 2014.
