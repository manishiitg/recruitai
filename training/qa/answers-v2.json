These search methods connected with the database of millions of resumes. These are the simple search engines who parses the resumes against the given keywords and offers the best match results. The list of the searching keywords is usually prepared by the HR after reading the job description several times. The HR downloads these searched resumes and does the manual work by opening and reading the resumes. By this way, HR person tries to find the resumes which are best match to the Job description. This is a cumbersome process and requires reasonable time and multiple discussion with the candidate before offering the resume to the client. Usually, due to the complexity of the database, many efficient resumes missed out from the search results or not considered due to stringent timeline ofclosure.\n\nTraditionalmethod 1 Human Resource (HR) agencies use various head hunting tools and online search methods.

HR manager collects resumes which are to be ranked and creates a list of resumes. The resumes should be in given format, so that the algorithm can rank the resumes based on that format.[2] 2. Parsing CV: Resumes can be in any format such as TEXT, PDF & DOCX. So for pre-processing and parsing of keywords from the resumes for processing by the algorithm, we are using different packages for each file format.  PyPDF2: PyPDF2 is a pure-python PDF toolkit originating from the PyPdf project. It is currently maintained by Phaseit, Inc. PyPDF2 can extract data from PDF files, or manipulate existing PDFs to produce a newfile.PyPDF2iscompatiblewithPythonversions2.6,2.7,and3.2-3.5.  Docopt: docopt is based on conventions that have been used for decades in help messages and man pages for describing a program's interface. An interface description in docopt is such a help message, but formalized.  Python-docx: python-docx is a Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (.docx)files. IV. List Ofkeywords: The company will provide a list of skills required for a particular post. The company will also give weight- age of each skill to be assigned in the keyword file. The algorithm will rank the resumes based on the keyword file.\n\nALGORITHM:\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning technique to separate data which tries to maximize the gap between the categories (a.k.a Margin).[3] Maximum Margin Classifieris the simple way to divide the data if it is linearly (or via a plane in multi- is dimensionalspace)separable.Butduetoobviousreasonsitcan‟tbeappliedtothedatawherenoclearlinear boundary possible. Support Vector Classifier is an extension to maximum margin classifier where some misclassifications are allowed to happen. Support Vector Machine is a further extension to SVC to accommodate non-linear boundaries. Though there is a clear distinction between various definitions but people prefer to call all of them as SVM to avoid any complications. SVM is a further extension of SVC that results from enlarging the feature space in a specific way using “KERNELS”. The main idea is that the system may want to enlarge its feature space in order to accommodate a\n\nInternational Conference on Innovative and Advanced Technologies in Engineering (March-2018) 2 |Page\n\nResume Ranker non-linear boundary between the classes. Dealing with high dimensional data or enlarging the feature space requires high computational power. The Kernel approach is simply an efficient computational approach for the same. Solution to the Support Vector Classifier problem involves only the inner – product of the observations and not the variables themselves. This is the basic idea behind using a Kernel technique. A Kernel is a function that quantifies the similarity of two observations. When a Support Vector Classifier is combined with a non- linear Kernel, the resulting classifier is known as SVM. Depending on the data one has to select the Kernel which best classifies it. There is no direct rule or formula which can choose a Kernel, most of the timesit will be trialanderror.Therearevariouscoefficientslike„gamma‟,\n\n„coef‟ whichonecantuneinordertoreacha bestclassification.\n\n „degree‟,\n\n V.\n\n Figures\n\n Figure 1: System Block Diagram\n\nHR manager collects resumes which are to be ranked and creates a list of resumes. Resumes are also collected from Github and LinkedIn. Resumes can be in any format such as TEXT, PDF & DOCX. The company will provide a list of skills required for a particular post. The company will also give weight-age of each skill to be assigned in the keyword file. The algorithm will rank the resumes based on the keyword file.\n\nInternational Conference on Innovative and Advanced Technologies in Engineering (March-2018) 3 |Page\n\nResume Ranker VI.  Expected Output\n\nResumes are ranked according to the keywords provided by the user and algorithm ranks the resumes from 1 to x, with rank one having 100 percentile. Here‟s the format of how the output will be displayed: (File_Format/Percentile/ [count] /Resume_name). A file_format is a type of the file which can be a .pdf or .docx or .txt. The percentile is calculated using a function (percentile = self.get_percentile(d, self.files)), where “d” is the method of parsing. Depending on the keywords and multiplier of that keywords assigned by the user, a count will be generated for a particular resume which will be displayed in square brackets. The formula to calculate count is (count = count + (keyword * multiplier)). Resume_name is the name of the file. Example: (PDF / 68.87% / [8] / DevrajRedkarResume). The formula for ranking of these resumes is (rank = rank + word_percentage).\n\nVII.\n\nFuture Scope As future work we plan to expand the application functionalities by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for large data sets especially for large organizations. Also for processing large amount of data based on text input we can improve the performance by using Natural LanguageProcessing.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nA benchmarking is done to observe the results obtained by the manual process and the resumes recommended by the proposed method through Machine Learning. The results obtained by the proposed method are mathematically and practically much better than traditional methods. Ranking and Re-ranking based on the Hiring Pattern are very useful for next generation Head Huntingsolution.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]. [2].

          "context": "Education Resume, Cover Letter RESUME  & Reference Guide\n\nOne of the most important aspects of your job search is creating your resume. On average, administrators spend less than 30 seconds screening it, so it is essential for your resume to project a clear and concise picture. The purpose of a resume is to market your education-related skills, experiences, and achievements so that you obtain an interview, therefore you should tailor your resume to the position you want.\n\nFormatting Tips\n\nThere are no set rules regarding how to format your resume, however there are general guidelines you can follow when writing your resume. Ultimately you are encouraged to pick the format that best highlights your skills and accomplishments.\n\nLENGTH: Education majors typically use a 2 page resume as there are a number of requirements and experiences education students acquire and those should be documented on your resume. PAGE NUMBERS: Always include Your Name, Page 2 on the second page of your resume, in case it gets separated from the first. PRIORITIZE: Place your most important information toward the top of the resume. You may want your first section to be titled “Teaching Experience”, where you would then include your student teaching positions. PROOFREAD: Check and recheck for spelling and grammatical errors. Have Career & Professional Development, as well as someone in the teaching profession, review your resume and provide feedback. FORMAT: Start with a blank Word document. You may want to start by making a list of all of your experiences, certifications, accomplishments. Avoid using templates because they may not allow you to easily move information or change bullets, fonts, or text sizes. PRINTING: Print your resume on quality, white, grey or off-white paper. SAVE: If e-mailing your resume, use your name when saving the document. Be sure to save your resume in multiple locations. PERSONAL INFORMATION: Do not include a photograph or other personal information such as age, weight, height, marital status. FONT: Use easy to read fonts (Ex: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Cambria, etc.). Keep font sizes between 10 point and 12 point.\n\nMARGINS: Keep margin widths between .5” and 1”.\n\nREQUIRED CONTENT • Name: Make sure your name stands out by using a larger font (16-22 point font) and bolding it. • Address & phone number o o Include only one phone number and use a professional outgoing message on your phone (e.g. You have reached the voicemail of Julie Fox, I am sorry I missed your call. Please leave your name, number and brief message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thanks.). Include a campus and a permanent address if you will be in different locations during your search. • E-mail address: A combination of your first and last name keeps your e-mail address professional (your SNC e-mail is good forever); remove the hyperlink.\n\nHeading\n\n• Personal website/LinkedIn public profile: Include personal websites only if they are directly related to your objective and will enhance your candidacy. You may consider creating your own online portfolio to highlight your subject area, classroom management plan, strong lesson plans, sample letters, pictures of a well-organized classroom in which you worked.\n\nHeading Examples Natalie L.

An objective is optional, however when used it can be general or specific. A general objective is most effective when attending a career fair, networking event, or uploading into Hire a Knight or WECAN. A specific objective is best used when applying to a particular position and should be tailored every time. General Objective: To obtain a position in the field of…(Early Childhood Education, Elementary School Education etc.) General objective example: Desire a position in the field of Early Childhood Education utilizing skills in positive behavior management and a strong interest in collaborating with colleagues and parents. Specific Objective: Desire a position as a… (5th grade teacher, high school Chemistry teacher etc.) with….

Aim for 5-9 bullet points for each student teaching experience • Choose simple but formal bullets such as circles, squares, or diamond.

Currently, the resumes are examined manually which takes a lot of time and efforts. In this paper we propose a solution where resume details will be extracted and analyzed by the system without human interaction. This will be achieved with the help of text mining technology. Text mining as a part of data mining is used to extract the text from the unstructured document and convert it into data for further analysis.\n\nvery tedious and time consuming process. The information related to applicant is redundant as data from resume is same as that extracted from the form. The space is wasted in saving redundant data which is not required.\n\nProblems with the existing system are: A. Redundant data B. More space required C. Time consuming to design D. Time consuming for the applicant as well E. Manual analysis of resumes and scheduling of interviews.\n\nIndex Terms— Resume Analyzer, text mining, keywords \n\n III. EXISTING SOLUTION\n\n I. INTRODUCTION\n\nResume Analyzer system implementation, and evaluation of an approach to apply text mining for analysing the resumes company receives using keyword matching algorithm. is With the help of Keyword matching algorithm, the keywords from the customized dictionary will be mapped against the words in the resume. Once the keywords are matched the required data is extracted and stored in the database. The entire database is sorted based on various parameters like experience, qualification, age, etc. Interview scheduling is performed next by the system based on the generated sorted list. Applicants are informed about the interview through an automated mail generated by system. As large numbers of people apply for the job, analysing each resume is difficult work. Also scheduling the interviews as per the sorting is a tedious job. We are attempting to reduce efforts on candidate’s as well as company’s side. The companies can adopt the system as a part of their recruitment process. The project has a wider scope as applicant does will prefer the system were they only need to upload their resumes.\n\nNowadays while applying for any job vacancy applicant needs to fill the company’s application form and also upload resume on company’s website. The application form, in general, is very lengthy and time consuming to design as well. The applicant needs fill all the details in the form which is\n\nAnkita Satish Vaidya, B.E (Information Technology), St. Francis India,Mobile of Technology, Mumbai, Maharashtra, Institute No.:808225774 Pooja Vasant Sawant, B.E (Information Technology), St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, Mobile No.:\n\n86554758203\n\nThere are prominently two ways to improve the readability of the resume: A. Company specific format of resume B. Information retrieval through application form A. Company specific format of resume: A specific format of resume is provided to applicants by a particular company. Stringent rules are enforced by companies to simplify their information retrieval process. This method is helpful for companies as extraction and selection process complexity reduces. But it becomes time and energy consuming for the applicants. B. Information retrieval through application form: A lengthy application form is mandatory before registering for the recruitment process. All the data available in resume is recurred in application form. Data redundancy is main issue with this solution. IV. PROPOSED SOLUTION\n\nIn the proposed system, we are just taking resumes as the input from the applicants and all the details about the applicant is extracted from the resume. This simplifies the work of the applicant and saves his/her time and effort. The system also automatically schedules the interviews for the applicants reducing the burden on Human Resource (HR) department. The prioritized list ensures that most deserving applicants are attended first. The sorting criteria and interview time and place is under is Administrator authority. Thus, scheduling process performed with administrator mediation.\n\n148 www.erpublication.org\n\nResume Analyzer An automated solution to recruitment process Fig.1. Flowchart for admin\n\nand data could also be used to ask the user, \"Did you mean Smythe?\" The Soundex algorithm applies a series of rules to a string to generate the four-character code. The encoding steps are as follows: A. Ignore all characters in the string being encoded except for the English letters, A to Z. B. The first letter of the Soundex code is the first letter of the string being encoded. C. After the first letter in the string, do not encode vowels or the letters H, W and Y. These letters may affect the code by being present but are not encoded directly. D. Assign a numeric digit between one and six to all letters after the first using the following mappings: 1: B, F, P or V 2: C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, Z 3: D, T 4: L 5: M, N 6: R E. Where adjacent digits are the same, remove all but one of those digits unless a vowel, H, W or Y was found between them in the original text. F. Force the code to be four characters in length by padding with zero characters or by truncation.\n\nHere, we have analyzed the proposed solution by examining the different conditions and results are as follows:\n\nA. An applicant can apply only once f or a particular post. B. Scheduling process requires administrator consent. C. Sorting process can be done using different criteria’s. D. Vacancy period is fixed and apply option is locked after a decided fixed date automatically. E. An internet connection is mandatory.\n\nFig.2. Flowchart for applicant Implementation is done using keyword matching algorithm i.e. Soundex algorithm.\n\nSoundex Algorithm:\n\nV. RESULT The Soundex algorithm generates four-character codes based upon the pronunciation of English words. These codes can be used to compare two words to determine whether they sound alike. This can be very useful when searching for information in a database or text file, particularly when looking for names that are commonly misspelled. Example: The search functions of a customer database. When performing a text search for the surname, \"Smith\", people with the name, \"Smythe\", would not be found. However, as the Soundex code for both surnames is \"S530\", a phonetic Soundex-based search would find both customers. The codes Fig.3.

Accruals over $500k need Controller approval,\nand over $1M needs CFO approval. This is at a divisional level.\n\n\n\nWe currently allow business units/locations to enter their own accruals, as well as certain inventory related JEs,\ndirectly into the financial system. However, we are in the process of transitioning the posting of these entries from the\nbusiness units to General Accounting so that General Accounting has the opportunity to review and approve the JEs\nprior to posting to the general ledger as required by company policy. In those ERP systems that have the capability to\npark JEs, we will rely on the parking functionality due to the volume of entries. For those systems that do not have\nparking functionality, we will require the business units to submit the JEs to General Accounting for processing.\n\n\n\nWe have an internally automated accrual tool; many requests meet pre-set criteria and require no further review, but\nsome do require further review by G/L before final posting.\n\n\n\nRegarding software, where units use the Ariba purchasing system, we use that to generate an accrual to be posted\nto SAP. Otherwise SAP POs generate an accrual proposal. Judgmental accruals are submitted by units to General\nAccounting in our SSCs.\n\n\n\n\nPosting is centralized at Corporate Accounting based on information provided by outsourced Shared Services.\nWe have both a business and SSC accrual process. The SSC accrual is mainly about Accounts Payable and\nemployee expense, with business units performing department accruals. The SSC accrual needs the General\nAccounting team’s review and the business accrual is posted directly.\n\n\n\nCurrently created and posted by other areas of Finance, although this is not necessarily the intention going forward.\n\n\n\nOur staff accountants review the business unit financials and make accruals on their behalf. The individual business\nunit does not make these decisions.\n\n\n\nIn our Global Financial Shared Services organization, we provide a “full service package” for the Business Units. This\nmeans the Shared Service Center receives the details for posting the accruals into the ledger and makes the entry.\n\nAchievements\n\n\n\n\nPlayed as a National Basketball Player in Kangra, Pondicherry & Shimla.\nAnchoring in different events at school and college level.\nParticipation in Drawing Competition at sophomore year.\n\nPersonal Dossier\nDate of Birth:\nCurrent Location:\nOther:\nReferences:\n\n27th March 1986\nDelhi\nHolding a Passport\nAvailable on Request\n\nDeclaration:\nI declare that the information given above is true and to the best of my knowledge.\nSachi Chauhan\n\n\f\f",

Also much time was required to port ABB applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch. This was a research project that studied the properties of preempt_rt patched Linux in real world scenarios and decided on worst case timings that will satisfy requirements in ABB’s robotic applications Other Tools Customer Benefit Description Embedded Linux for Integrated Paint System - eLIPS NOATM, SEROP Bangalore Since Feb 2008. This project evaluated the real time properties of preempt_rt linux to deploy Linux based BSP (board support package) for use in IPS(Integrated Paint System) of ABB’s paint robots and validate its performance in real world applications. 4 persons  Porting rt-preempt linux and u-boot to the paint interface board.

Such porting does not provide any value addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.\n\nProject Name Role Work Location Team size Description Responsibilities Description Safety Board Software Developer Bangalore 4 persons This project involves putting a Linux BSP on the MPC8323 based safety board and porting the safety application to Linux Linux kernel testing – Create an automated tool which will deploy all linux kernel functional and performance tests on all embedded boards running on linux BSPs and store the result logs on a server.
