Accruals over $500k need Controller approval,\nand over $1M needs CFO approval. This is at a divisional level.\n\n\n\nWe currently allow business units/locations to enter their own accruals, as well as certain inventory related JEs,\ndirectly into the financial system. However, we are in the process of transitioning the posting of these entries from the\nbusiness units to General Accounting so that General Accounting has the opportunity to review and approve the JEs\nprior to posting to the general ledger as required by company policy. In those ERP systems that have the capability to\npark JEs, we will rely on the parking functionality due to the volume of entries. For those systems that do not have\nparking functionality, we will require the business units to submit the JEs to General Accounting for processing.\n\n\n\nWe have an internally automated accrual tool; many requests meet pre-set criteria and require no further review, but\nsome do require further review by G/L before final posting.\n\n\n\nRegarding software, where units use the Ariba purchasing system, we use that to generate an accrual to be posted\nto SAP. Otherwise SAP POs generate an accrual proposal. Judgmental accruals are submitted by units to General\nAccounting in our SSCs.\n\n\n\n\nPosting is centralized at Corporate Accounting based on information provided by outsourced Shared Services.\nWe have both a business and SSC accrual process. The SSC accrual is mainly about Accounts Payable and\nemployee expense, with business units performing department accruals. The SSC accrual needs the General\nAccounting team’s review and the business accrual is posted directly.\n\n\n\nCurrently created and posted by other areas of Finance, although this is not necessarily the intention going forward.\n\n\n\nOur staff accountants review the business unit financials and make accruals on their behalf. The individual business\nunit does not make these decisions.\n\n\n\nIn our Global Financial Shared Services organization, we provide a “full service package” for the Business Units. This\nmeans the Shared Service Center receives the details for posting the accruals into the ledger and makes the entry.\n\nAchievements\n\n\n\n\nPlayed as a National Basketball Player in Kangra, Pondicherry & Shimla.\nAnchoring in different events at school and college level.\nParticipation in Drawing Competition at sophomore year.\n\nPersonal Dossier\nDate of Birth:\nCurrent Location:\nOther:\nReferences:\n\n27th March 1986\nDelhi\nHolding a Passport\nAvailable on Request\n\nDeclaration:\nI declare that the information given above is true and to the best of my knowledge.\nSachi Chauhan\n\n\f\f",

My journey with this\norganisation is as narrated below in\nreverse chronology:\n\nHR Manager on roles of\nRTTS India Pvt. Ltd. (Apr 2013 –\nSep 2014): Initially started as HR\nManger to cater the hiring needs of\nan\nOff\nShore\nDevelopment\nCentre(ODC) (Established in Delhi by\nRTTS\nIndia\nin\ncontract\nand\ncollaboration\nwith\nSCS\ngroup\nWESEE). My prime responsibilities\nwere to hire and built a team of 25\nsoftware and hardware engineers for\nODC. Being the functional head\nmajor\nresponsibilities\nincluded\nHiring,\nQuality\nManagement,\nInventory management, Handled\ndeliverables, making HR policy for an\noffice of strength 30-40 people,\nlaying\ndown\nand\nstreamlining\nprocesses for HR. While fulfilling\nthese responsibilities I was reporting\nto and communicating with HR Head\n(RTTS Bangalore), VP Operations\n(RTTS Delhi) and HOD (SCS Group\nWESEE)\nwith\ndifferent\naspects\npertaining to the job. With this, I was\nshouldered\nwith\nadditional\nadministrative\nresponsibilities\nof\nODC.\n\nTransition from HR Manger\nto Quality (Oct 2014 – Apr 2016):\nWith\nabove\nprofessional\nresponsibilities,\npar\nalley\non\npersonal,\nhave\ntaken\nup\ncertifications in Six Sigma Master\nBlack Belt, ISO Stds, Lean, ITIL,\nproject management etc. Same time\nWESEE was going through its journey\nof first CMMI Appraisal. With all these\nlearning presented a live MBB project\nto HOD (SCS WESEE) on increasing\nQuarterly sales, which was based on\nmy case study on hiring engineers\nfor ODC. Hence was selected as\nQuality Analyst for the group and\nactively took part in CMMI journey &\nmajestically sailed the group through\nappraisal journey by enhancing and\nstrengthening process adherence\nand\nimbibing\ndata\nanalytics\ncapabilities in teams. Put in lots of\nefforts in mentoring and increasing\n\nknow how of CMMI framework, develop measurement and metrics for\nthe group and tracking and analysing them. Also got exposure to IBM\nautomation tools (Change Management, DOORs, Raphsody etc). As\nSQA successfully sailed the group through CMMI journey and was\nawarded as best performer. The journey was a learning experience.\nSame also feathered me with lots of certifications and opportunity of\nbeing ATM in CMMI appraisal 2015. These efforts gave me\nrecognition in WESEE (An organisation constituting total of 8 groups)\n\nSQA to Sr. Process and Quality Analyst (May 2016 – Till\nDate). With the CMMI appraisal I had proved myself as a good\nprocess and data oriented person hence was consumed by the\nStandards and Processes (S&P) group of WESEE on roles of A\nB Impressions Pvt.

It was a challenge in itself to\nautomate QMS with some of the other groups already using IBM\ntools. Took part in lots of iterating sessions conducted by S&P\ngroup in collaboration with Digite team for Requirements\ndevelopment and understanding of VOC of other Groups (As each\ngroup have its unique way of functioning and caters some unique\nproduct to navy). It took a period of 3 years progressively to\nconvince people and bring an organisational change for automation\nwith project management activities given priority.\no\nStandards and Frameworks\nacquainted and worked on\nIEEE Stds\n IEEE std.12207\n IEEE std 1058 –PMP\n ISO/IEC/IEEE\n16326\nInternational Standard - Systems\nand\nSoftware\nEngineering--Life\nCycle\nProcesses--Project\nManagement\n IEEE 830-1998 Std Software for\nRequirement specification\n IEEE 730-2014 Software Qulity\nassurance plan\n IEEE\n1012-2004\nSoftware\nverification and Validation\n IEEE -1016 – 2009 Software\nDesign\n IEEE -1045 Software productivity\nMetrics\n IEEE – 1063 Software User\nDocumentation\n IEEE – 1074 Developing S/W\nlifecyce Process\n IEEE – 15288 System & S/W\nengineering\nProgramming Languages, tools\n IEEE – 828 – 2012 Configuration\nand\nTechnologies\nworked\non\nmanagement\nin Software\n& system\n Data\nanalysis tools: R, Advance\nEngineering\nexcel,\nbasics of SAS, Minitab\n\n ALM\ntools:\nWISDOM, IBM change\nCMMI framework\nmanagement,\n CMMI DevIBM\nV1.3Rational Team\nconcert, Raphsody, IBM Doors,\n CMMI Svc V1.3\nDNG, Digite Swift.\n Project Management\n 7 QC tools: Histograms, Control\n PMBok\ncharts,\nGraphs,\nscatter\nplots,\n Prince 2 cause\nregression,\nand\neffect\n SCRUM\ndigrams,\npereto, check sheets\n ITIL\nOperating Systems: Linux, Unix,\nWINDOWS\n VLSI Tools: FPGAs, VHDL, Verilog,\nCadance EDA tools.\n Programming Languages: C, C++\n MS World tools: MS project, Excel,\nWorld.\n\n\nContact Me:\nEmail ID: artibhatia@gmail.com\nMobile: 9971173300\n\n\fArti Bhatia: Profile 2019\nSr. Software and Process Quality Analyst\n\no\nStrengthening\nof\nConfiguration\nManagement\nprocess: A major initiative taken up\nby S&P group for which I given the\nresponsibility as process owner.
