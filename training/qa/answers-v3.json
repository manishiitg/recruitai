Controller Configuration Tool (CCT) is used to configure,\nsimulate, and commission the devices used in BAS. CCT operates in three modes:\nConfiguration, Simulation, and Commissioning. You can connect using a Wireless\nCommissioning Converter (MS-BTCVT-1) or BACnet® router or using a USB adapter\nwith ZigBee® driver for your computer when using the ZFR wireless system or\nusing the Ethernet Passthru mode.\n\n2.\n\nFDD & MAP Gateway- Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) technology uses\nmultiple sensors to constantly monitor refrigeration circuit temperatures and\npressures, economizer operation and outdoor humidity and temperatures.
