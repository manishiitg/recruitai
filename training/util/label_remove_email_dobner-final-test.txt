World-Education  O
System  O
Brief  O
Description:  O
The  O
virtual  O
classroom  O
is  O
a  O
web-based  O
platform  O
for  O
online  O
cooperation  O
and  O
enhancement  O
of  O
the  O
communication  O
between  O
students  O
and  O
the  O
lecturer.  O
A  O
virtual  O
learning  O
environment  O
(VLE)  O
is  O
an  O
education  O
system  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
Web  O
that  O
models  O
conventional  O
real-world  O
education  O
by  O
integrating  O
a  O
set  O
of  O
equivalent  O
virtual  O
concepts  O
for  O
tests,  O

homework,  O
classes,  O
classrooms,  O
and  O
the  O
like,  O
and  O
perhaps  O
even  O
museums  O
and  O
other  O
external  O
academic  O
resources.  O
It  O
is  O
an  O
electronic  O
learning  O
environment  O
where  O
teachers  O
and  O
students  O
are  O
separated  O
either  O
by  O
time,  O
space  O
or  O
both  O
by  O
using  O
the  O
internet  O
or  O
intranet  O
infrastructure.  O
Virtual  O
education  O
system  O
primarily  O
implemented  O
in  O
higher  O
education  O
but  O
it  O
is  O
now  O
becoming  O
popular  O
as  O
many  O
schools  O
also  O
adopting  O

this  O
system.  O
Some  O
institutes  O
are  O
now  O
using  O
the  O
joint  O
system  O
of  O
conventional  O
and  O
virtual  O
and  O
while  O
some  O
are  O
converting  O
totally  O
to  O
virtual  O
system.  O
The  O
teacher  O
provides  O
course  O
content  O
and  O
assignment  O
to  O
the  O
student  O
through  O
course  O
management  O
applications,  O
multimedia  O
resources,  O
the  O
internet,  O
videoconferencing,  O
etc.  O
Students  O
receive  O
the  O
content  O
and  O
assignment  O
and  O
then  O
perform  O
his  O
task.  O

For  O
