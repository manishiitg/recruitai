This O
Project O
presents O
a O
heuristic-search O
algorithm O
called O
Memory-bounded O
Anytime O
Window O
A* O
(MAWA*), O
which O
is O
complete, O
anytime, O
and O
memory O

MAWA* O
uses O
the O
window-bounded O
anytime-search O
methodology O
of O
AWA* O
as O
the O
basic O
framework O
and O
combines O
it O
with O
the O
memory- O
bounded O
A* O

approach O
to O
handle O
restricted O

situations. O
Simple O
and O
efficient O
versions O
of O
MAWA* O
targeted O
for O
