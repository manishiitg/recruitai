Project  O
Description:  O
The  O
aim  O
of  O
this  O
project  O
is  O
to  O
use  O
control  O
engineering  O
principles  O
and  O
concepts  O
to  O
provide  O
a  O
microcontroller  O
based  O
soil  O
moisture  O
sensing  O
system  O
In  O
crop  O
production  O
a  O
healthy  O
water  O
balance  O
is  O
essential  O
for  O
high  O
quality  O
yields..  O
Under-watered  O
crops  O
suffer  O
from  O
nutrient  O
deficiencies  O
while  O
over-watered  O
plants  O
are  O
more  O
susceptible  O
to  O
diseases  O
pressure  O
and  O
can  O
in  O
some  O
cases  O
lead  O
to  O
root  O
death  O
through  O
suffocation..  O
The  O
system  O
will  O
help  O
in  O
saving  O
money  O
and  O
water  O
and  O
at  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
increasing  O
crops  O
production..  O
The  O
automated  O
irrigation  O
system  O
is  O
controlled  O
using  O
ATmega16  O
micro  O
controller..  O
The  O
system  O
is  O
programmed  O
via  O
the  O
microcontroller  O
to  O
give  O
interrupt  O
signal  O
to  O
the  O
sensing  O
system  O
(sensor,  O
GSM  O
etc..)  O
depending  O
on  O
the  O
soil  O
moisture  O
levels..  O
The  O
soil  O
moisture/humidity  O
levels  O
are  O
checked  O
using  O
soil  O
moisture  O
sensor  O
Whenever  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
change  O
in  O
moisture/humidity  O
in  O
the  O
soil  O
this  O
sensor  O
senses  O
the  O
change  O
and  O
gives  O
an  O
interrupt  O
signal  O
to  O
the  O
micro-controller  O
and  O
thus  O
the  O
GSM  O
system  O
is  O
activated  O
or  O
deactivated.  O

This  O
Project  O
presents  O
a  O
heuristic-search  O
algorithm  O
called  O
Memory-bounded  O
Anytime  O
Window  O
A*(MAWA*),  O
which  O
is  O
complete,  O
anytime,  O
and  O
memory  O
bounded.  O
MAWA*  O
uses  O
the  O
window-  O
bounded  O
anytime-search  O
methodology  O
of  O
AWA*  O
as  O
the  O
basic  O
framework  O
and  O
combines  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
memory-bounded  O
A*  O
-like  O
approach  O
to  O
handle  O
restricted  O

situations.  O
Simple  O

versions  O
of  O
MAWA*  O
targeted  O

A*  O
(MAWA*),  O

of  O
AWA*  O
as  O
the  O
basic  O
framework  O
