A  O
virtual  O
learning  O
environment  O
(VLE)  O
is  O
an  O
education  O
system  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
Web  O
that  O
models  O
conventional  O
real-world  O
education  O
by  O
integrating  O
a  O
set  O
of  O
equivalent  O
virtual  O
concepts  O
for  O
tests,  O

homework,  O
classes,  O
classrooms,  O

Some  O
institutes  O
are  O
now  O
using  O
the  O
joint  O
system  O
of  O
conventional  O
and  O
virtual  O
and  O
while  O
some  O
are  O
converting  O
totally  O
to  O
virtual  O
system.  O
The  O
teacher  O
provides  O
