algorithm  O
called  O
Memory-bounded  O
Anytime  O
Window  O
A*(MAWA*),  O
which  O
is  O
complete,  O
anytime,  O
and  O
memory  O
bounded.  O
MAWA*  O
uses  O
the  O
window-  O
bounded  O
anytime-search  O
methodology  O
of  O
AWA*  O
as  O
the  O
basic  O
framework  O
and  O
combines  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
memory-bounded  O
A*  O

approach  O
to  O

A*  O
Algorithm  O

This  O
Project  O
presents  O
a  O
heuristic-search  O
algorithm  O
called  O
Memory-bounded  O
Anytime  O
Window  O
A*  O
(MAWA*),  O
which  O
is  O
complete,  O
anytime,  O
and  O
memory  O
bounded.  O
MAWA*  O
uses  O
the  O
window-bounded  O
anytime-search  O
methodology  O
of  O
AWA*  O
as  O
the  O
basic  O
framework  O
and  O
combines  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
memory-  O
bounded  O
A*  O
-like  O
approach  O
to  O
handle  O
restricted  O
memory  O
situations.  O
Simple  O
and  O
efficient  O
versions  O
of  O
MAWA*  O
targeted  O
for  O
tree  O
search  O
have  O
also  O
been  O

presented.  O
Experimental  O

Description:  O
The  O

A  O
virtual  O

environment  O
(VLE)  O
is  O
an  O
education  O
system  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
Web  O
that  O
models  O
conventional  O
real-world  O

by  O
integrating  O
a  O

perhaps  O
even  O
museums  O

Some  O
institutes  O
are  O
now  O
using  O
the  O
joint  O
system  O
of  O
conventional  O

virtual  O
and  O
while  O
some  O
are  O
converting  O
totally  O
to  O
virtual  O
